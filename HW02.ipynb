    "#Removed Unnecessary List Modifications:\n",
    "#In the original code, the list of doors was repeatedly modified (removing and re-adding doors). In the simplified version, we replaced this with list comprehensions that directly compute the doors we need, making the process more efficient and readable.\n",
    "#Replaced try-except Block:\n",
    "#The original code had a try-except block to handle cases where your chosen door was the same as the winning door. The new version avoids this entirely by filtering the doors upfront using list comprehensions.\n",
    "#Simplified Monty's Choice:\n",
    "#Monty’s choice of revealing a \"goat\" door is now done more directly by filtering out both your initial choice and the winning door at once. This reduces complexity and makes it clearer which doors are being handled.\n",
    "#Direct Door Switching:\n",
    "#Instead of dynamically removing and re-adding doors to find the remaining door, we now directly compute which door you switch to using a simple list comprehension.\n",
    "#Clear Variable Names:\n",
    "#We introduced clearer variable names like available_doors and remaining_door to make the logic of choosing, revealing, and switching doors more intuitive.\n",
    "#How This Helps:\n",
    "#Clarity: The process of choosing a door, revealing a goat door, and switching is now more explicit, with fewer operations happening \"behind the scenes.\"\n",
    "#Efficiency: The list comprehension approach reduces the need for manipulating the door list multiple times, making the code easier to follow and a bit more efficient.\n",
    "#Readability: Fewer lines of code and simplified logic make it easier to understand the core steps in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The code after simplfy is obviously more easy to read and understand, as all the change as made above simplyfy the code by not just a bit, most importantly\n",
    "#it removes the try-except block which I have never seen before. it feels different to read things you are familiar with and never seen before.\n",
    "#its also more organized and cut some code out to keep the code short, more easy to understand. "

    "This code is constructing a first-order Markov chain model using a sequence of words (words). Here's how it works:\n",

    "word_used dictionary: This keeps track of how many times each word appears in the words sequence.\n",
    "next_word dictionary: This is a nested dictionary where each word is mapped to another dictionary. The inner dictionary keeps track of how often each word follows the current word. Essentially, it records transitions between words.\n",
    "Looping through words: The loop iterates over all words in the list words, except the last one (because you need to look at the next word as well).\n",
    "For each word word at index i, it checks:\n",
    "If word exists in word_used, it increments the count. If not, it initializes the count in word_used and adds word to next_word with an empty dictionary.\n",
    "It then checks if the next word (words[i+1]) is already in next_word[word]. If it is, it increments the count of how often that transition (from word to words[i+1]) occurs. If not, it initializes this transition with a count of 1.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If the words list is [\"hello\", \"world\", \"hello\", \"everyone\"], after the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used = {\"hello\": 2, \"world\": 1}\n",
    "next_word = {\"hello\": {\"world\": 1, \"everyone\": 1}, \"world\": {\"hello\": 1}}\n",
    "This data structure is used to predict the next word in a sequence by looking at past transitions.\n",

    "This extension builds upon the original Markov chain model, but instead of using a first-order Markov chain, it constructs a second-order Markov chain. Let's break it down in the context of the original code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Changes and Additions:\n",
    "Second-Order Chains:\n",
    "In a second-order Markov chain, the next state depends on the current state and the previous state. In this case, the \"state\" is now a pair of two consecutive words, rather than just one word.\n",
    "The variable word_used2 tracks how often each pair of consecutive words appears, and next_word2 tracks which word follows that pair.\n",
    "Modifications in Loop:\n",
    "Instead of using just word (one word at a time), you now consider a pair of words: word + ' ' + words[i+1]. This concatenates the current word with the next one to form a two-word phrase.\n",
    "You then predict the word that follows this two-word phrase (words[i+2]).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let’s say the input words list is [\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\", \"at\", \"school\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used2:\n",
    "Tracks how often each pair of consecutive words occurs:\n",
    "word_used2 = {\"I am\": 1, \"am a\": 1, \"a student\": 1, \"student at\": 1}\n",

    "Tracks which word follows each pair of consecutive words:\n",
    "next_word2 = {\"I am\": {\"a\": 1}, \"am a\": {\"student\": 1}, \"a student\": {\"at\": 1}, \"student at\": {\"school\": 1}}\n",
    "Comparison with the Original Code:\n",
    "Original (first-order): Predicts the next word based on a single word (e.g., after \"I\", predict \"am\").\n",
    "Extended (second-order): Predicts the next word based on a pair of words (e.g., after \"I am\", predict \"a\").\n",
    "Benefit:\n",
    "Second-order models can capture more context from previous words, making predictions more accurate in some cases, especially for structured language patterns where context from the last two words is more informative than just one.\n",

    "The avatar.character column (which contains character names) is processed into a Counter object called characters. This converts the character names into uppercase, replaces spaces with periods (.), and then counts how often each character appears.\n",
    "Nested Dictionary Structure (nested_dict):\n",
    "The code defines word_used2C and next_word2C as nested dictionaries using a lambda function and defaultdict. These dictionaries will store word transitions specific to each character.\n",
    "word_used2C: Keeps track of how many times each pair of consecutive words appears per character.\n",
    "next_word2C: Tracks which word follows a given word pair per character.\n",
    "Processing the Words and Characters:\n",
    "The code iterates through the words list, similar to the previous extensions, but adds a character-specific aspect. If the current word (word) matches a character name in characters, it assigns this word to character.\n",
    "Once a character is identified, the code updates word_used2C[character] and next_word2C[character], storing word pair transitions and their counts specific to that character.\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose the words list is [\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\", \"at\", \"school\"] and avatar.character contains the characters \"Aang\", \"Katara\", etc. The characters Counter converts these names and counts occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \"Aang\" is identified as a character in the words list, the code will start building word transitions specifically for \"Aang\".\n",
    "Let's say:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used2C[\"Aang\"] = {\"I am\": 1, \"am a\": 1, \"a student\": 1}\n",
    "next_word2C[\"Aang\"] = {\"I am\": {\"a\": 1}, \"am a\": {\"student\": 1}, \"a student\": {\"at\": 1}}\n",
    "This means that for the character \"Aang\", the word \"I am\" is followed by \"a\", and \"am a\" is followed by \"student\", etc.\n",
    "Key Differences from Previous Versions:\n",
    "Character-Specific Word Modeling:\n",
    "This extension tracks word transitions separately for each character in the dataset. The dictionaries word_used2C and next_word2C now store word pairs and transitions in a nested structure, where each character has its own set of word pair transitions.\n",
    "Character Context:\n",
    "When generating text or predicting the next word, this version allows the model to incorporate character-specific behavior. It can make different word predictions depending on which character is currently being processed.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "This extension takes the second-order Markov chain further by adding character-specific word modeling. Instead of having one global set of word transitions, the code maintains separate word transitions for each character in the dataset. This allows the chatbot to behave differently for different characters, potentially capturing personality or dialogue nuances specific to each character\n",

    "Markovian Chatbot Extension #1: Second-Order Markov Chain\n",
    "Recap of the Original Markov Chain Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original chatbot code used a first-order Markov chain, meaning it predicted the next word based on a single preceding word. This worked by keeping track of word transitions (e.g., after \"hello\", the next word might be \"world\"). However, it lacked more contextual understanding because only one word at a time was considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of the Second-Order Markov Chain (Extension #1):\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extension, we move to a second-order Markov chain. Instead of predicting the next word based on just the previous word, we predict the next word based on the last two consecutive words. This approach captures more context by considering two words, making the prediction more informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of Code Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used2 Dictionary:\n",
    "This defaultdict(int) counts how often each pair of consecutive words appears in the words list.\n",
    "For example, if words = [\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\"], then the dictionary will track:\n",
    "\"I am\", \"am a\", \"a student\".\n",
    "next_word2 Dictionary:\n",
    "This nested dictionary stores the transitions between word pairs and the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "Example: If \"I am\" is followed by \"a\", the dictionary records:\n",
    "next_word2[\"I am\"][\"a\"] += 1\n",
    "Meaning, the word \"a\" follows \"I am\".\n",
    "Loop Explanation:\n",
    "The loop iterates over words[:-2], meaning it skips the last two words since we need a pair (two words) to predict the next word.\n",
    "Inside the loop:\n",
    "It constructs a word pair (word + ' ' + words[i+1]), e.g., \"I am\".\n",
    "Updates the word_used2 dictionary to count how often that pair appears.\n",
    "Updates the next_word2 dictionary to count which word follows that word pair.\n",
    "Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a words list like [\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\"]:\n",
    "\n",
    "word_used2 = {\"I am\": 1, \"am a\": 1}\n",
    "next_word2 = {\"I am\": {\"a\": 1}, \"am a\": {\"student\": 1}}\n",
    "This second-order Markov chain provides more context, as it predicts the next word based on two words instead of one. This improves the chatbot's ability to generate more coherent and contextually accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markovian Chatbot Extension #2: Character-Specific Markov Chains\n",
    "Purpose of the Character-Specific Extension (Extension #2):\n",
    "\n",
    "The second extension further refines the Markov chain model by personalizing it for each character in the avatar dataset. This means the word transitions are now specific to a character. Different characters will have their own set of word transition patterns, making the model capable of mimicking the unique speech patterns of individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of Code Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters Dictionary (characters):\n",
    "The code processes the avatar.character column, converting character names to uppercase, replacing spaces with dots (.), and using Counter to count occurrences of each character. This creates a mapping of all characters from the dataset.\n",
    "Example: If avatar.character contains [\"Aang\", \"Katara\"], characters will look like:\n",
    "Counter({\"AANG:\": 1, \"KATARA:\": 1})\n",
    "Nested Dictionary Setup (nested_dict):\n",
    "word_used2C and next_word2C are nested dictionaries that store word pairs and transitions per character. The lambda function creates deeply nested dictionaries on demand.\n",
    "Main Loop:\n",
    "The loop iterates through words and checks if the current word (word) is a character in characters.\n",
    "Once a character is identified, it switches to recording word transitions for that character.\n",
    "Tracking Word Pairs and Transitions per Character:\n",
    "word_used2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]]: Keeps track of how often a word pair appears for a specific character.\n",
    "next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]][words[i+2]]: Tracks which word follows the word pair for that character.\n",
    "Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the words list is [\"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"student\", \"at\", \"school\"], and the character avatar.character contains \"Aang\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As the loop processes the words, if the word \"Aang\" is encountered, it starts tracking transitions for \"Aang\":\n",
    "word_used2C[\"AANG\"] = {\"I am\": 1, \"am a\": 1}\n",
    "next_word2C[\"AANG\"] = {\"I am\": {\"a\": 1}, \"am a\": {\"student\": 1}}\n",
    "Now, when generating text, the chatbot can switch between different word transitions depending on which character is speaking, thus personalizing the dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Both Extensions:\n",
    "Extension #1 (Second-Order Markov Chain):\n",
    "Builds on the original Markov chain by predicting the next word based on two preceding words, providing more contextual information.\n",
    "Extension #2 (Character-Specific Markov Chain):\n",
    "Adds character-based transitions, allowing the chatbot to generate text specific to the speaking style or dialogue of each character in the dataset.\n",
    "Together, these extensions make the Markov chain chatbot more sophisticated, both by improving the contextual predictions (second-order chain) and by adding personality to the chatbot’s responses (character-specific chains).\n",

    "\n",
    "chatgpt is able to help with most question quickly, once I give the question or code, the generate of the answer is fast and at the same time the accuracy is also high. In question 1, explaning the code, which is not possible if you want to do that by google searching. However, once I give the code and my request to chatgpt, the full explanation is returned. Chatgpt is like a real person who has all the knowledge you need and can give responce to every of your question as long as you describe the question clearly. In question 2 and 3, simplfying the code, which I can't imagine how I can do it without chatgpt. The answer given by chatgpt is obviously more readable and clear, I can just copy the code and use it directly. It also provide whith detailed explanations. It saves me a lot of time on researching what each line of code does and simplfying/debuging the codes. In question 4, chatgpt also provide significant amount of help on answering my questions on Markov chain to deepen my understanding. Every question can be answer by chatgpt accuratly and by explaning the code, not a single mistake has made. In question five, even though we are intend to test how chatgpt explain the code with only part of code given, it still gives the correst explaination, there are a few details that are missing but once you clairify the detail chatgpt will fix it.\n",

For example, debugging, I wrote a peice of code but it keep poping error messages, it will take me a long time to figure out where and why it's wrong specially when I'm learning or using new knowledges I just learn. However, I have chatBots. Every time I copied my code and the error message to chatgpt, it can always fix my code in a few second and explain to me clearly where and why it is wrong. It is even more convience than asking another person. And if I still have places that I don't understand, I can keep asking chatgpt, and it will patiently answer my question one by one.

It has been an amazing experience with chatgpt and has changed a lot of my thought on AI assistence tools in the context of learning. I have hearing about chatgpt for a long time and people around me are also talking a lot about it. At first I thought maybe it's just another kind of AI that just can chat with you using akward grammer and words, then I thought maybe it can solve some simple code and math. I have never think about that I will use it to help me learning. I seen it as a toy that you can play with it when you are bored. However, when I join the course and start using chatgpt, I found that I was wrong and regret that I didn't use it earlier in my highschool life. For my first homework, I heard that we are asked to use chatgpt to help us writing code, and the first thought I have is that it would make so much mistakes and I have to fix them by my own. My thought quickly changed as I start the homework. I found that the real case is that I write many mistakes and I need chatgpt to fix them for me and explain, help me understand new concept and codes. It can provide answer to my queston when I'm stucked on some part and help me improve myself more efficiently.

    "While AI tools and assistants can significantly help with certain tasks, becoming a statistician or data scientist without coding or hands-on data analysis is challenging. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Core of Statistics and Data Science\n",
    "The essence of both fields lies in working directly with data—whether it's designing experiments, conducting statistical tests, or building models. Even with AI tools assisting in automation, having foundational knowledge in these areas is crucial for effective decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians:\n",
    "\n",
    "Main responsibilities involve designing surveys/experiments, analyzing data, and interpreting results. While AI can assist in parts of this process (e.g., automating some analyses), understanding the underlying logic is critical for ensuring the results are valid.\n",
    "AI assistants could help automate routine statistical computations or visualizations, but you still need to understand the concepts to select the appropriate methods, verify results, and interpret findings.\n",
    "Data Scientists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Main responsibilities include cleaning and preparing data, building machine learning models, interpreting the results, and communicating findings. While some platforms provide drag-and-drop interfaces, having knowledge of data manipulation and statistical reasoning is essential to ensure the models make sense and perform well.\n",
    "AI assistants can automate parts of this (e.g., generating code snippets, running models, or creating visualizations), but human intervention is necessary for tasks like feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and making final interpretations.\n",
    "2. Limitations of Relying Solely on AI Assistants\n",
    "AI assistants can assist with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating routine coding tasks (e.g., writing SQL queries, Python code, or simple data manipulations).\n",
    "Providing recommendations for data cleaning, model selection, and statistical tests.\n",
    "Simplifying some analyses by generating insights from raw data automatically.\n",
    "However, they currently cannot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the context behind your data or specific business problems.\n",
    "Make nuanced decisions about statistical methods or model selection (e.g., choosing between logistic regression and random forests).\n",
    "Interpret results in a meaningful way for a specific audience or application.\n",
    "Handle edge cases and unexpected results (such as when data violates assumptions of statistical tests).\n",
    "3. Industry Expectations\n",
    "Most employers expect a statistician or data scientist to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding skills (e.g., Python, R, SQL) to manipulate and analyze data efficiently.\n",
    "The ability to perform data analysis using various tools (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn).\n",
    "Statistical knowledge to make decisions about data collection, analysis, and interpretation.\n",
    "AI tools can complement your skillset but are not yet capable of replacing the foundational expertise required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Possible Roles with Less Coding/Data Analysis\n",
    "If you want to work in a data-related field without coding or heavy data analysis, you could explore roles that involve more domain expertise, communication, or oversight rather than hands-on technical tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Strategist/Consultant: Focuses on identifying data-driven opportunities for businesses, without necessarily executing the technical work.\n",
    "Business Analyst: Primarily works on interpreting data insights generated by data scientists, using AI tools for report generation.\n",
    "Data Science Product Manager: Oversees data science projects, ensures alignment with business goals, and works closely with technical teams.\n",
    "5. AI Tools to Minimize Coding\n",
    "AutoML Platforms (e.g., Google AutoML, H2O.ai): These platforms automate model building and can significantly reduce the need for manual coding in machine learning workflows. However, understanding what the models are doing and being able to interpret the results is still necessary.\n",
    "No-code/Low-code Platforms (e.g., Alteryx, KNIME, Tableau): These allow for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization without writing much code, but a basic understanding of data principles is still important.\n",
    "In Conclusion:\n",
    "While AI assistants can make the work of statisticians or data scientists more efficient by automating parts of the process, you will still need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the core concepts of statistics and data analysis.\n",
    "Be able to interpret results and tailor them to specific business or research needs.\n",
    "Have some familiarity with the coding and data manipulation process to verify and fine-tune AI-generated results.\n",
    "In short, AI tools are a great supplement, but they are not yet capable of fully replacing the technical skills and critical thinking that statisticians and data scientists bring to their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To become a statistician, there are several key skills and areas of knowledge that will be most valuable. Here’s a breakdown of the core skills you should focus on, as well as what you can do or learn to develop them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strong Mathematical Foundation\n",

    "Summary of Interactions with ChatGPT\n",
    "1. Career Path Exploration: Statistician vs. Data Scientist I discussed my interest in pursuing a career in statistics and explored the skillsets needed for a statistician or data scientist. We examined how core skills like learning adaptability, communication, coding, and data analysis play a vital role in the data science industry. I sought clarification on whether it's possible to become a statistician or data scientist without coding or data analysis, considering the potential use of AI tools. ChatGPT emphasized that while AI can assist in automating tasks, core competencies in coding and data analysis are still essential for these roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key Skills for a Career in Statistics I asked what specific skills would be most valuable for becoming a statistician. ChatGPT recommended building a strong foundation in mathematics (especially probability theory, linear algebra, and calculus), core statistical knowledge (such as descriptive and inferential statistics, regression analysis, and multivariate methods), and proficiency in data analysis. It also suggested learning programming languages like R and Python, which are vital for modern statistical work, as well as developing data visualization and communication skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Importance of Coding in Statistics We explored the importance of coding in the field of statistics. ChatGPT explained that coding skills are crucial for handling large datasets, automating repetitive tasks, implementing advanced statistical methods, and creating customizable data visualizations. Even though it is theoretically possible to be a statistician without coding, coding is becoming increasingly expected and necessary in both academic and industry roles. This makes learning languages like R, Python, or SAS highly recommended for statisticians.\n",

    "8.4 Paraphrase the assessments and conclusions of your conversation in the form of a reflection on your current thoughts regarding your potential future career(s) and how you can go about building the skills you need to pursue it\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to be a computer engineer or statistician in the future, while these two career path has many similarities like they all require coding skills, critical thinking skills, and many more. So that I can decide which one I'm more interested during the learning process. I don't have to learn things that's totally different no matter which one of the two I chose. Firstly I have to practice my coding skills by taking more CS related courses, practice more with coding, and at the same time coding can train my logical thinking skill. Then I'm going to read more books like \"Statistics for Business and Economics” by Anderson and “The Elements of Statistical Learning” by Hastie et al to wider my sights and learn more deep into it. Finally I have to experience to truly understand the content. I'm going to join some communities related to CS and statistics also find some part time job related if possible.\n",

    "8.5 Give your thoughts regarding the helpfulness or limitations of your conversation with a ChatBot, and describe the next steps you would take to pursue this conversation further if you felt the information the ChatBot provides was somewhat high level and general, and perhaps lacked the depth and detailed knowledge of a dedicated subject matter expert who had really take the time to understand the ins and outs of the industry and career path in question.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chatgpt is again, very useful learning tool but it has limitations. For example, if I ask chat to fix my code or refine my code, it going to do a perfect job, but if I ask it to create a peice of code from nowhere, somtimes the code will pop error messages. Chatgpt's answer is pretty general at most time, only when I'm asking more high level topic I may have to ask it to answer shorter and simple. My next step is continue using it as a learning assistant through the process.\n"
