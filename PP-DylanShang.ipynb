    "I would first clean my data by removing observations that has NA in the columns I need, by removing missing data, I'm able to collect a meaningful, and clearer version of my data which will improve the readability and is easier to compute with. Only removing missing observations that has missing data in the above to columns because we only need these to columns, it can keep our data as much as possible.\n",
    "Then I will ensure consistency of my data by checking all the data types are correct, check the range of data as they are represent by numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, I will also seperate my data into two groups, one with more than 4 days social days and one for the rest. Then i will define two new variable to hold on to my two groups of data and cut them only having one columns LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score because I don't need all the other columns and keeping them will only lower my data clarity. \n",

    "First using bootstraping method to generate 10000 bootstrap samples for both the samples with the same size of my original sample with replacement using one for loop, in each time the loop runs, for every new sample I create for two data, I subtract the mean of the second(more than 4 days) from the mean of the first data and store these 10000 result. then by taking the 0.025 and 0.975 quantile, I can get a 95% confidence interval.\n",

    "Expected result:\n",

    "This will relate to the objectives of course project as it focus on how the interaction of community, in this case friends, has impact on one's life experience. loneliness can be very serious somtimes. It can caused a student to spend most of their time struggles, suffuring by mental illness. By studying how social days impact lonelyness, we can raise up the problem that maybe we should spend more time on social instead of studying. Parents also should pay attention to children's interpersonal relationships.\n"
